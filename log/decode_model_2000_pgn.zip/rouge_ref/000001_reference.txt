) The reason games like Chess and Go have been used as milestones , aside from longstanding human interest in the games , is that they provide models with simple , fully definable parameters , and , in the case of Go at least , have complexity akin to nature , by which I mean unsolvable / intractable.
) Because we 're starting to talk about more `` generalized intelligence '' , defined here as mechanisms that can be applied to a set of problems , ( I include minimax as a form of `` axiomatic intelligence '' and machine learning as a form `` adaptive intelligence '' ) , it may be worthwhile to expand and clarify the definition : Intelligence is the problem solving strength of a mechanism in relation to a problem or a set of problems , relative to the strength of other mechanisms.
