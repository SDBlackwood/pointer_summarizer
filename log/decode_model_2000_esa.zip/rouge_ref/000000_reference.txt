For example : set in Python HashSet in Java At first glance , it may seem like adding all the states you ever see to a set like this will be expensive memory-wise , but it is not too bad in comparison to the memory you already need for your frontier ; if your branching factor is $ b $ , your frontier will grow by $ b - 1 $ elements per node that you visit ( remove $ 1 $ node from frontier to `` visit '' it , add $ b $ new successors/children ) , whereas your set will only grow by $ 1 $ extra node per visited node.
