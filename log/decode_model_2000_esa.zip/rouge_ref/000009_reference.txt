Perhaps the shortest answer to this question is that Bayes ' Theorem itself allows us to easily change the direction of a conditional probability : $ $ P ( A|B ) = \frac { P ( B|A ) P ( A ) } { P ( B ) } $ $ So if you have $ P ( B|A ) $ , $ P ( A ) $ , and $ P ( B ) $ , we can determine $ P ( A|B ) $ , and similarly you can determine $ P ( B|A ) $ from $ P ( A|B ) $ , $ P ( B ) $ and $ P ( A ) $.
