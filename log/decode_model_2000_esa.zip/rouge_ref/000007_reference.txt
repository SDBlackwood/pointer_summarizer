Since a neural network does iteratively learn its own weights I assume you mean the structure of the neural network - the number of layers and nodes per layer.
Google wrote a blog where they used machine learning to explore the architecture of a neural network calling it the AutoML project where the blog claimed `` To make this process of designing machine learning models much more accessible , weâ€™ve been exploring ways to automate the design of machine learning models.
'' It was found that AutoML can design small neural networks that perform on par with neural networks designed by human experts , but these results were constrained to small academic datasets like CIFAR-10 , and Penn Treebank.
